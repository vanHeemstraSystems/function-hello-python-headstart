In sum, deploy OpenFaaS with Kubernetes or with faasd, pick one and follow the instructions: [OpenFaaS Deployment](https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/)

Use the instructions given to you to log in with ```faas-cli login```

You can try out one of the sample functions from the Function Store.

For instance The function named hubstats will tell you how many Docker Hub images a user has. I typed in my user account and found out I have almost 200 already!
