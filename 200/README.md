# 200 - Install the OpenFaaS CLI

See https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/openfaas-cli-headstart

The CLI is a convenient way to interact with your functions. You can use it to build and/or deploy functions to your cluster.

In short, on Linux type in:

```
$ curl -sSL https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
```

***Note***: If you're using Windows, then you're not out of luck, you can actually find the Windows executable on the [FaaS releases page](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases/tag/0.4.5-b).
